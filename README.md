# FRESQL
This repository contains exploratory code for integrating Structured Query Language (SQL) into the GFDL FMS Runtime Environment ([FRE](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fre/)). Requests for features in the next iteration of FRE should be submitted to the issue board on the [GFDL FRE repository](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/FRE).
